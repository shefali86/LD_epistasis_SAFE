INTRODUCTION
============

SAFE (or Spatial Analysis of Functional Enrichment) is an automated network annotation algorithm. Given a biological network and a set of functional groups or quantitative features of interest, SAFE performs local enrichment analysis to determine which regions of the network are over-represented for each group or feature. SAFE visualizes the network and maps the detected enrichments onto the network.

SAFE was originally implemented in MATLAB and stored at  <https://bitbucket.org/abarysh/safe/>. However, as of early 2017, the MATLAB implementation is only maintained for legacy purposes. New work related to SAFE is moving  to Python and this repository. 

**WARNING. This package is still in development. Please use caution.**


GETTING STARTED
===============

SAFE requires Python 3 and a set of packages listed in `extras/requirements.txt`. We recommend setting up a virtual environment and installing all the required packages via pip:

```
cd safepy/
virtualenv -p python3.6 safepy_env
source safepy_env/bin/activate
pip install -r extras/requirements.txt
```

After the installation is complete, it is useful to run a "hello world" SAFE analysis using the Jupyter notebook at `examples/Example_1_GI_network_doxorubicin.ipynb`. 

To do so, from within the safepy_env environment install a new ipython kernel:

```
ipython kernel install --user --name=safepy_env
```

Then start jupyter, open `examples/Example_1_GI_network_doxorubicin.ipynb` and select the safepy_env kernel.

```
jupyter-notebook
```

To run the examples, several common datasets will be required (e.g., the genetic interaction similarity network from Costanzo et al., 2016). These datasets are stored separately at <https://github.com/baryshnikova-lab/safe-data> (to avoid duplication with other SAFE-related repositories and packages). We recommend cloning the safe-data repository and storing it locally (e.g., at <path_to_safe-data_folder>). In addition, it is necessary to edit the SAFE settings file (at `safepy/safe_default.ini`) with the path to the `safe-data` folder.

```
vim safe_default.ini
...
[DEFAULT]
safe_data = <path_to_safe-data_folder>
...
```
